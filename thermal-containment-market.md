<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Containment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Aisle Thermal Containment</li><li>Hot Aisle Thermal Containment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal containment market comprises two primary types: cold aisle and hot aisle containment. Cold aisle containment involves structuring data centers so that cold air is directed into a contained aisle, preventing warm air from mixing, thereby optimizing cooling efficiency. Conversely, hot aisle containment focuses on enclosing the hot air exhaust from servers, directing it away from cooling units. Both methods are designed to enhance energy efficiency, improve equipment performance, and reduce cooling costs in data centers.</p></p>
