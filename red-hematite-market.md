<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Red Hematite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fines</li><li>Pellets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Red Hematite market primarily consists of fines and pellets. Fines are fine-grained iron ore particles, often used in sintering processes to produce sinter feed for blast furnaces. They are cost-effective but require agglomeration. Pellets are spherical, high-grade iron ore agglomerates made from fines, offering superior iron content and reduced impurities. They are preferred in direct reduction and blast furnace operations due to their efficiency and environmental benefits. Both types cater to steel production, with pellets commanding a premium for their quality and ease of use.</p></p>
