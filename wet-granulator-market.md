<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet Granulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-shear</li><li>Low-shear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wet granulator market is divided into two primary types: high-shear and low-shear granulators. High-shear granulators utilize intense mixing and centrifugal forces to produce fine, uniform granules, making them ideal for pharmaceutical and food processing applications. In contrast, low-shear granulators apply gentler mixing techniques, suitable for more fragile materials, and result in larger granule sizes. The choice between high-shear and low-shear granulators depends on the specific requirements of the product, such as particle size and density.</p></p>
