<p><h1>Phenylketonuria (PKU) Market with the goal of estimating the market size and future growth potential of various market segments based on component, applications and end user</h1></p><p><strong>Phenylketonuria (PKU) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many protein-containing foods. If left untreated, high levels of phenylalanine can lead to severe intellectual disability and other neurological issues. The management of PKU primarily involves a strict diet low in phenylalanine, supplemented by medical foods and formulas designed to provide necessary nutrients without harmful levels of the amino acid. </p><p>The PKU market is witnessing significant growth driven by rising awareness, improved diagnostic methods, and the ongoing development of innovative therapies. Advancements in biotechnology and personalized medicine are creating opportunities for better management options, thus enhancing patient compliance. The increasing prevalence of PKU is also prompting healthcare providers and governments to invest more in health programs and research. Additionally, the trend towards neonatal screening has contributed to early diagnosis and intervention, crucial for effective management. </p><p>As a result, the Phenylketonuria (PKU) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period, reflecting the growing demand for effective treatment solutions and dietary management options for individuals suffering from this condition.</p></p>
