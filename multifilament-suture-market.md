<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifilament Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Suture</li><li>Non Absorbable Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multifilament suture market is segmented into absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures degrade over time in the body, eliminating the need for removal and are typically used for internal suturing where healing is expected. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, remain intact indefinitely and are used for wounds requiring long-term support, such as in skin closures or specific surgical procedures. Both types offer distinct benefits tailored to various surgical needs and patient care strategies.</p></p>
